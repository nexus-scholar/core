# Release Readiness

Last updated: 2026-05-22

This document defines the release gate for `nexus-scholar/core`. It is intentionally separate from feature roadmaps: a release can ship only when the package can be installed, validated, and reasoned about without local workspace assumptions.

## Current Status

Ready for pre-release consumers:

- Composer metadata validates strictly.
- Composer scripts exist for tests, static analysis, and formatting checks.
- GitHub Actions runs the supported PHP/Laravel matrix.
- Laravel config and migrations are publishable through `nexus-config` and `nexus-migrations`.
- `.gitattributes` excludes local IDE, agent, storage, temporary, test, and legacy planning artifacts from package archives.
- Domain and application layers are guarded against framework leakage by architecture tests.
- Legal OA full-text retrieval avoids shadow-library adapters.

Not ready for a stable `1.0` tag yet:

- Immutable locked corpus snapshots are still pending. Current lock membership is inferred from project work links.
- Host-facing HTTP/API surfaces are not part of this package yet.
- Release notes and semantic-versioning policy are not formalized.
- The graph packages must be available to Composer consumers through tags or Packagist-compatible repository configuration.

## Release Gate

Run these commands before tagging or opening a release PR:

```powershell
composer validate --strict
composer test
composer analyse
composer format:check
git diff --check
composer archive --format=zip --file=tmp/nexus-scholar-core
```

The archive smoke check should succeed and produce a package zip that excludes:

- `.github`, `.idea`, `.cursor`, local agent files, and IDE files,
- `tests`, `vendor`, `storage`, `tmp`, and generated caches,
- old package review files and UI planning material,
- local query examples and lock files.

## Consumer Install Check

Before a stable release, test installation from a clean Laravel application:

```powershell
composer require nexus-scholar/core
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nexus-config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nexus-migrations
php artisan migrate
php artisan list nexus
```

Expected package-owned commands:

- `nexus:search`
- `nexus:screen`

Host applications may expose additional commands, but they must remain thin wrappers around core use cases.

## Required Environment

Minimum useful Laravel values:

```dotenv
NEXUS_MAIL_TO=you@example.com
NEXUS_UNPAYWALL_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

Optional provider credentials:

```dotenv
NEXUS_IEEE_API_KEY=
NEXUS_S2_API_KEY=
NEXUS_PUBMED_API_KEY=
NEXUS_LLM_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
```

Never commit real credentials. Provider availability should be controlled through config/env, not code edits.

## Stability Rules

- Keep domain and application code independent from Laravel, Eloquent, queues, storage, and facades.
- Add ports before infrastructure-specific dependencies.
- Keep package commands delegated to application services.
- Keep live network calls out of CI; use fakes or VCR fixtures.
- Add a regression test for every bug found through `nexus-cli` command output when the behavior belongs to `core`.
- Do not add shadow-library full-text sources.

## Next Release Hardening Items

Priority order:

1. Immutable locked corpus snapshots for final/citable exports.
2. Clean release notes and semantic-versioning policy.
3. Clean install smoke test in a new Laravel application using tagged graph dependencies.
4. Host API examples for search, screening, adjudication, comparison, full-text, graph, and export flows.
5. Packagist/package archive review after graph package tags are published.
